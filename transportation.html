<h1>Transportation</h1>
        <p> Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive
            on a small cruise ship that docks in Yello Leaf Bay for one
            night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
            accomodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process
            of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the
            island within the next few years.
        </p>

            Ground Transportation: Publics buses serve Tanity City and run from 
            5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the
            island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be
            rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and
            helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are
            required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many
            tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is
            easy to explore on foot.
