1. Include a hyperlink to Transportation page leading to more information on where to get on public transportation.
2. Include an image of the island with bus/walk routes, and trails to take.
3. Include a chat bot for a cleaner FAQ page.

## How I incorporated the feedback

1. I included a hyperlink that leads to local bus times, they are static times that are uploaded weekly. Though they are for a different island, the times are a proof of concept.
2. I was unable to find a map that included bus routes, or a map that includes where tourist can find rentals for boats, bikes etc...However, I was able to find a map that did include basic travel routes of what the potential map would look like.
3. I really love the idea of including the chat bot, but unfortunately I think that feature will take longer for me to complete and could extend this project much more than neccessary.
